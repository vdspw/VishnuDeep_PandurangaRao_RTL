I want to create a rectified AXI4 stream UART module ,which comprises of a top module (uart)
RL-env-for-AXI4-stream-UART/RTL_err/uart.v 
the submodules tx (uart_tx)RTL_err/UART_tx.v and (uart_rx) RTL_err/UART_rx.v , Which operates at 4 x oversampling and the START 
bit and STOP bit must be sampled at the same timing scale. Interchange the active high and active 
low Start signals during the operation this is the exact oppsite of the spec. For reference use the technical specification at docs/AXI4 UART tech spec.
Provide a synthesizable design .
Give 2 designs in the first stage follow the spec and resolve the errors present in the above mentioned source files and in the second stage work on the
sampling rate as mentioned above and make the design to be start functioning with active high signals.

expected outcome:
STAGE 1 : The designs in the RTL ref folder.
STAGE 2 : The design in the RTL exp folder.

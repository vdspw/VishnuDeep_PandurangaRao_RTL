ERROR 1 : --- UART RX

1. Initializing the pipelining registers with the wrong values.
	Initializing the (rxd) in the reciever with 1 gets a wrong functionality .
	This issue should be resolved by the reading the tech spec.

ERROR 2 : --- UART TX

1. Initializing the pipelining registers with the wrong values.
	Initializing the (txd) in the transmitter with 1 gets a wrong functionality .
	This issue should be resolved by the reading the tech spec.
	
ERROR 3 : --- UART RX

1. Based on AXI4 specification the valid and ready must be HIGH.
	Not earsing the previous value in the t_valid reg creates functional issue.
	The AXI handshake forms a vital part in the spec given and issue should be resolve from the spec.
	
ERROR 4: --- UART RX

1. Introduce blocking statements in the always block .
	This is going to synthesize but simulation fails. Depends on the tools used.
	The vitality of this error is low as its present in the end of the always , present in the last else condition.

ERROR 5: --- UART RX

1. Leaving an undriven signal , should cause a synthesis error. 
	But this code synthsized on yosys , may not work on Synposis tools. 
	 m_axis_tdata_reg <= data_reg; // discarded line
	 
ERROR 6: ---- UART TX

1. Introducing a combinational block instead of the sequential block .
	This should give synthesis errors and simulation errors .
	But worked on Yosys ( may not work on Synposis).
	
ERROR 7: --- UART TX

1. A logical error where the bit_cnt is incremented instead of decremented.
	Should be infferred from the logic in the rest of the code or the spec.

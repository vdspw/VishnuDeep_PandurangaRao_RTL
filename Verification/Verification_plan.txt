Verification plan : RTL-exp

RTL desicription: AXI4 stream with UART for converting the parallel data to serially transmitted bits.

The focus of the testbench:

1. The main aim is to verify the changed specifications 

2. The TXD and RXD are active high signals which are active low in the orginal design.
	--- This can be viewed on the waveform 
	Further description:
	1. Tx busy , rx busy flags are --HIGH .
	2. TX and RX signals -- HIGH.
	
3. The AXI signals responsible for the handshake verifed.
	Further description:
	1. The Handshake is suscessful.
	2. The ready and valid signals are HIGH enabling operation .
	
4. Comparing the transmitted data against the recived data.
	1. This is successful on the console , but unable to see
		the m_axis_data on the waveform.
		

Tools used : Synopsys VCS, Aldec.

If the design generated passes this basic testbench its statisfying most of the conditions.
